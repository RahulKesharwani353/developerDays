    about:"Android has dominated the global smartphone operating system market share for several years now. According to research company Gartner, in the second Quarter of 2016, Android led worldwide new smartphones sales by 86.2%. Kotlin is object-oriented and supports functional programming features. It is designed for the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). That is fully compatible with JAVA. Kotlin is Java with some extra pieces of stuff. You can easily use JAVA libraries in Kotlin’s project, but Kotlin gives you more out of the box. It is focused on interoperability, safety, clarity, and tooling support. You can use it to a code Back-end server, Android Apps or even iOS app using Kotlin Native. Another interesting fact is that you can compile Kotlin to JavaScript. In this course, you’ll learn building Android apps with the Kotlin programming language. Along the way, you'll develop a collection of apps to start your journey as an Android developer. This Boot-camp will kick start your journey as a android Developer. With the help of hands on Project, Daily & weekly challenges it will provide a perfect environment for Staring android Development.",
